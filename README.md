# Video_Classification
The repository builds a two approaches for video classification (or action recognition) using UCF50 using TensorFlow. To propagate a video through a model, we randomly select a specific number of frames from it. Below are two neural nets models:
Human_action_recognition using ConvLSTM and Pose Detection using MediaPipe.
